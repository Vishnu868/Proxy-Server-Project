# Proxy Server with Web Caching using Socket Programming

## Project Description

This project is a **Proxy Server** implementation built using **Socket Programming in C/Python**, designed to handle client-server communication efficiently. It includes core functionalities such as:

- Forwarding client requests to the server.
- Caching frequently accessed web content.
- Improving network performance via local cache responses.

The proxy server serves as a **middleman** between clients and destination web servers, providing **anonymity, security, content filtering, and performance enhancements**.

## Features

-  **Client-Server Architecture** using sockets
-  **Proxy-based content filtering and security**
-  **Web caching for faster data retrieval**
-  **Load balancing concepts (optional)**
-  **Request logging and monitoring**

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how **client-server architecture** works.
- Implement **TCP/IP socket communication** in code.
- Learn how **proxy servers filter and forward requests**.
- Develop basic **web caching** functionality.
- Enhance knowledge of **computer networks and OS concepts**.
